# theStack!

A simple todo app written in ruby that runs on [heroku][2] using [sinatra][3].

Based upon [the data structure][1]. 

Code started from the [example heroku sintra app][4].

## General Concept

I want an easy way to store notes, and to categorise them based on what they are. 
Preferably the system would display a pile of notes.
