# theStack!

A simple app to help you remember your ideas. Runs locally thanks to sinatra.

Orginally inspired by [the data structure][1]...

## General Concept

The general idea is a pile of notes and ideas that are searchable.

## Installation 

 * if you are on Debian, make sure you install `libsqlite3-dev`, `ruby-deb` and `libopenssl-ruby`
 * You need to install all of the gems listed in .gems.
 * This works better on ruby 1.8, but should work in 1.9 as well.
 * to launch, run `rake`.
 * point your browser at <http://localhost:4567>
