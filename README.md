# theStack!

A simple todo app with a little ajax magic and a php backaend.	

Based upon [the data structure][1]. 

## General Concept

I want an easy way to store notes, and to categorise them based on what they are. 
Preferably the system would display a pile of notes. 
Then at the top I would click a sorting option and it would maybe bring items due soon, or items I created a long time ago, etc.
